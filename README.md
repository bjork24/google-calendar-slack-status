## Finding your SLACK_TOKEN

Slack recently changed how users interact with their API. To find your SLACK_TOKEN, follow these instructions:

1. Create a new Slack bot [here](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1).

1. Once the app has been created, click on the "OAuth & Permissions" link on the sidebar

1. Scroll down to "Scopes" and set the following permissions:
  - `dnd:write`
  - `users:write`
  - `users.profile:write`

1. Copy the `OAuth Access Token` at the top of the page, and use it as your **SLACK_TOKEN**
